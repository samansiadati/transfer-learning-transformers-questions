# 200 Questions About Transfer Learning and Transformers

## Companion Repository

This repository is a **study companion and practical implementation guide** for the book ***200 Questions About Transfer Learning and Transformers***.

The goal of this project is to provide a **practical, question-driven approach** to understanding transfer learning and transformer models by offering:

* Clear, concise explanations of key concepts
* Step-by-step answers and worked examples
* Python implementations and small experiments
* Visualizations to build intuition for transformer behavior
* Exercises and practice questions for self-study

> 📌 **Important note**: This repository is a **learning aid** and does **not** contain the book itself, nor does it reproduce copyrighted content. All explanations, code, and exercises are original.

## 🎯 Who This Repository Is For

This repo is designed for:

* Students learning **transformers, transfer learning, and modern NLP**
* Practitioners who want to **strengthen their understanding through Q&A**
* Engineers preparing for **interviews involving transfer learning and transformers**
* Researchers who want a **quick reference and hands-on implementation examples**

If you have ever thought *“I understand transformers at a high level, but I want to be able to answer detailed technical questions”*, this repository is for you.

## 🧠 Core Topics Covered

The repository follows a question-driven structure covering:

* **Fundamentals of Transfer Learning** (feature extraction, fine-tuning, domain adaptation)
* **Transformer Architecture** (self-attention, multi-head attention, positional encoding)
* **Pretrained Language Models** (BERT, GPT, T5, etc.)
* **Sequence Modeling & Generation** (autoregressive models, masking strategies)
* **Practical Applications** (text classification, summarization, question answering)
* **Evaluation Metrics** (perplexity, BLEU, ROUGE, accuracy)
* **Best Practices & Scaling** (efficient training, memory optimization, hyperparameter tuning)

Each topic is explored through **Q&A**, with explanations, mathematical intuition, and coding examples.
